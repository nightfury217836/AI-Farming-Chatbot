Bring your garden to life with artificial intelligenceâ€”right inside your terminal! ðŸŒ±

In this video, I showcase a Python + PyTorch project that:

Identifies plant species from a single photo ðŸ“¸

Detects plant diseases and suggests treatments ðŸ©º

Offers fun facts, history, and interactive Q&A ðŸ’¡

Youâ€™ll see:
âœ… How the dataset is organized and retrained
âœ… How transfer learning (ResNet) powers accurate predictions
âœ… A live demo of species & disease detection with confidence scores
âœ… Tips for extending the model with your own data

Perfect for students, developers, or garden enthusiasts who want a hands-on machine learning project thatâ€™s both practical and fun.
